After a few months of trying and testing this thermostat, I decided that I want to go a little bit further. This means that Im
switching the Arduino Mega for an ESP32-S3 with WIFI and BT support, so I would be able to design and program a Web interface,
alerts, ... 

I will be doing that project on another repository and in fact, it will be my final degree project, so It would be more refined.

# Terrarium_Controller
An implementation of a terrarium controller (thermostat, day &amp; night cycle, humidity levels...) using an Arduino Mega 2560.

Disclaimer:
If you decide to take this project as inspiration, be watchfull. This was my first take on a project like this and there are 
better ways of doing the things that I did, like avoiding the use of sleep() for other and better ways. Nevertheless, the code
is fully functional.
